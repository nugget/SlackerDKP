1.15 (23-Jun-2006):
  o You can now flag loot in-game as "disenchanted" and it will be ignored
    during import.  This is a little less risky than just deleting the line

    DE'd loot in the future.

  o Integrated waitlist with snapshots 
  o Minor bug fixes
  o Added key binding for waitlist window toggle

  o Bugfix: Item threshhold applied to announceloot messages

1.12 (13-June-2006):
  o Added ability to move loot events up and down the list for better
    DKP award flexibility.
  o Added dkpplayer setting for Hydra/Slaves of the Fist

1.10 (14-May-2006):
  o New version, this time properly including Slacker_DKP_EditLoot.xml.

1.09 (12-May-2006):
  o Added "rarity" setting
