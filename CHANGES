1.17 (3-Jul-2006):
  o Added a UI scaling function (/sdkp set scale <#>)
  o Temporarily disabled "unlisted alt" warnings until I can arrange a
    better way of handling that.

1.16 (27-Jun-2006):
  o Bugfix: Fixed error dialog that appeared when a person on the list 
    made it into the raid.
  o Waiting list sends reminders to the top 3 players whenever the list
    changes.
  o Waiting list displays in red if raid has fewer than 40 players.

1.15 (23-Jun-2006):
  o You can now flag loot in-game as "disenchanted" and it will be ignored
    during import.  This is a little less risky than just deleting the line
    entirely and leaves open the possibility of more flexible handling of 
    DE'd loot in the future.
  o Corrected ItemInfo bug which caused errors when looting multiple-item
    drops.

1.14 (16-June-2006):
  o Integrated waitlist with snapshots 
  o Minor bug fixes
  o Added key binding for waitlist window toggle

1.13 (14-June-2006):
  o Bugfix: Item threshhold applied to announceloot messages
  o Added window for editing saved bosses list
  o Added raid waiting list feature and corresponding window.

1.12 (13-June-2006):
  o Added ability to move loot events up and down the list for better
    DKP award flexibility.
  o Added dkpplayer setting for Hydra/Slaves of the Fist

1.10 (14-May-2006):
  o New version, this time properly including Slacker_DKP_EditLoot.xml.

1.09 (12-May-2006):
  o Added "rarity" setting
  o Added "active" setting
  o Added ability to edit player name for loot log entries
  o Added log throttling to prevent errors if two loot entries occur
    in the same second.
